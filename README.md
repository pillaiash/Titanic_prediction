# Titanic Survival Prediction
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook for predicting survival on the Titanic using machine learning techniques. The notebook covers data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, and evaluation.

# Introduction
The Titanic Survival Prediction project aims to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster using machine learning. The notebook demonstrates the complete workflow, from data loading and preprocessing to model training and evaluation.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Titanic dataset, which can be found on Kaggle. It contains information about the passengers, including age, gender, class, and whether they survived.

# Requirements
To run the notebook, you need the following libraries:

pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
You can install the required libraries using the following command:

# Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/titanic-survival-prediction.git

# Navigate to the project directory:

cd titanic-survival-prediction

# Open the Jupyter notebook:

jupyter notebook Titanic.ipynb

Run the cells in the notebook to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.
